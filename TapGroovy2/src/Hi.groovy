Exercises:


1. Implement Haskell exercises in Groovy:
    a) Create a function listIntegers(n,list) that returns a list with integers between 0 and n.
    b) Create a function listBetween(start,end,list) that return a list with the elements between start and end in the list.
    c) Modify to show only multiples of two in the list.
    d) Implement the function digits that receives an integer and converts it to a list of integers. Implement two versions with stack and tail recursion.
        --  digits(3645) --> [3,6,4,5]
    (...) See Haskell labs and exercises.
2. Modify FileSystem with metaprogramming to include an operation that can add new methods to the Tree and Leaf structures. This would enable adding new
   operations to the Tree.
