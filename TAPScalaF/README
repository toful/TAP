Exercises
----------------------------------------

1. Solve the following exercises:


  a) Given the list if Integers from 1..100, return the list of odd numbers from this list, and then obtain the power of each element of the list
     ex1 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] -> [1,9,25,49]

   b) Create a function ex2 that accepts a list of Ints,  one function that filter the list and one function that modifies the list (map)

   c) Use currying and partial parametrization to create a new function evenapply that reuses ex2 for even numbers (filter function).

   d) Create a function ex3 like ex2 but for any type in the list. Show examples with different types.

2. Solve exercises in Exercises1.txt
    Recursion

3. Implement filter and reduce in Scala
    Use currying and demonstrate partial parametrization with both filter and reduce.


4. Solve exercises2.txt and exercises3.txt in Scala.

5. Create a List of Persons (name,phone, age).
   a) Use the function reduce or fold to obtain the oldest person in the list
   b) Obtain the phones of the persons whose age is greater than 40
