Exercises

Exercise 1. Implement the composite pattern (FileSystem) in Scala

Exercise 2. Implement the singleton pattern in Scala

Exercise 3: We will import information from the accounts.txt file in CSV format (Comma separated values). Use Files.
Import this information in a List of Accounts where the four parameters correspond to:
  id :String, owner:String, kind:[IF,CA,BA,SA], balance:Int
  ** you do not need to use enums, use Strings **

Perform the following operations:
 Use map to increment the balance of all accounts in 10 euros
 Use filter to obtain all account of kind IF
 Use max to obtain the account with the highest balance
 Combine filter and max to obtain the IF account with higher balance

4. Solve Exercise4.txt tree exercises.
